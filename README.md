Simple Rework of Deadly Carnage to allow Dex based Characters to have access to the mechanic, with altered name and description for Flavour.

Prerequisites are now :

- Dex 15              ( changed from Str )
- Piranha Strike      ( change from Power attack )
- Dazzling Display    ( unchanged )
- BAB 11              ( unchanged ) 

No weird behaviour ( hopefully ) and nothing needing set, just plug and slay.

Special Thanks as usual to Balkoth, Kuru, Cascade and everyone else for putting up with my dumb penguin brainmush and catching my mistakes and also VS doing dumb things.

Changelog : 

1.1.1 :

- Added Prerequisite info to Piranha Strike
- Added Prerequisite info to Dazzling Display
